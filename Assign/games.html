            <h2>Astro Bot</h2>
            <p>
                Astro Bot is an unrelentingly joyful experience. From the vibrant, colourful levels that reward curiosity at every turn, to the incredibly creative power-ups, screen-filling bosses and endless PlayStation Easter eggs to hunt down, it’s a video game sugar rush without the crash. And like the aforementioned pack-in game that preceded it, Astro Bot is a wonderful showcase for the DualSense controller. You feel everything that happens in the game in your hands too, right down to the adorable little robot’s footsteps, and that tactility only adds to the enjoyment.

            <h2>Marvel spiderman</h2>
            <p>
                Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is also the first game in the series that lets you play as both Peter Parker and his protégé, Miles Morales, and while the main narrative is perhaps a bit too Peter-heavy, it’s a joy to see the two Spider-Men team up to save the city while trying to balance superhero duties with their normal lives. The game is a stunning showcase of the PS5’s tech when it’s firing on all cylinders, further cementing Insomniac’s status as the console’s most reliable hit-maker.

            <h2>Humanity</h2>
            <p>
                The latest game from the studio behind the now legendary Tetris Effect has reimagined another classic puzzle game, only this time it’s Lemmings. In Humanity you play as a Shiba Inu (a hunting dog breed from Japan) that is tasked with guiding enormous crowds of humans to a goal by dropping directional commands on the floor that they obediently follow. At least, that’s what you’re doing initially.            </p>

            <h2>Ghost of Tsushima </h2>
            <p>
                Ghost was already one of the best examples of a last-gen title that’s instantly improved by the PS5, and the Director’s Cut is now the definitive version. As well as benefiting from the shorter loading times, the game runs at a perfect 4K/60fps, making one-on-one duels – already one of the game’s strong points – even more epic to behold. And it looks mind-blowingly beautiful. Japanese lip-syncing – one of the most asked-for features from fans – has been added to the PS5 game, as well as some generous DualSense trickery and 3D audio support.     </p>
