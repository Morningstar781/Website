        <h2>The PlayStation lineup is getting bigger, with the addition of the PS5 Slim and the upcoming PS5 Pro. The cybernetic clamshell tower of a console is packed to the gills with killer hardware. The PlayStation 5 can run games in native 4K, hit frame rates over 120 frames per second, and render gorgeous, ray-traced environments in stunning detail. Still, not everything you need comes in the box. A few more add-ons will make your game sessions more enjoyable. From charging docks and gaming headsets to storage expansion cards and the PlayStation Portal, these are the best PS5 accessories of the dozens we've tested.

            Be sure to check out our other PS5 guides, including the Best PS5 Games, PS5 vs. PS5 Slim vs. PS5 Pro Comparison, and tips to get the most out of the console.
            
            Updated October 2024: We added the PowerA DualSense Charging Dock, DualSense Edge Controller, PS VR2 Sense Controller Charging Dock, the Samsung S90D QD-OLED TV, and info about the PS VR2 PC adapter.</h2>

        <h1>Charging dock</h1>
        <h2>There's nothing more annoying than inviting your buddy over for some couch co-op, only to discover that your less-favorite controller is dead. That's where charging docks come in. Keeping multiple controllers charged is a task too big for a single USB cable. It's much nicer to drop them in a dock when you're done playing instead of remembering to plug them back in. We previously featured Sony's official charging dock, but this one from PowerA is a little cheaper and, for my money, a nicer experience. It has a mirrored layout with a convenient arch in the center for the charging cable, so it doesn't look out of place no matter how you orient it on your entertainment unit. Plus, it matches the white-on-black aesthetic of the PS5 without looking too ostentatious.</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Dual Controller</h1>
        <h2>It's 2024 and game consoles still don't ship with two controllers. The first thing you'll need with your new PS5 is an extra gamepad if you want to get in on any couch co-op, and the best one is still Sony's official DualSense model. No other third-party controller packs the same level of immersive feedback as the DualSense.</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Wireless headset</h1>
        <h2>The Arctis 7P+ is one of my favorite gaming headsets for good reason. It gets up to 30 hours of battery life and comes with a wireless USB-C dongle that makes it compatible with most systems. So you can use it for your extended Spider-Man 2 sessions, and then swap it over to your Switch, or even use it with your phone. It doesn't hurt that these headphones sound great too.</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h1>PS5 Remote</h1>
        <h2>The PS5 isn't just an excellent game console. It also has apps to watch shows and movies on Netflix, Hulu, Max, and all the other streaming services. The downside is that the PS5 controller is a little annoying to use as a TV remoteâ€”especially if you share the space with non-gamers. The PS5 Media Remote is the perfect solution to this nuisance. When paired with the console, it can automatically set itself up to control power and volume to most TVs and soundbars, and the battery life from just two AA batteries lasts for months.</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>VR Headset</h1>
        <h2>The PS VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) features impressive eye-tracking, which stands out in games like Horizon Call of the Mountain. In this title, you can highlight menu items just by looking at them. The Sense VR controllers boast best-in-class haptic feedback, making it feel like you're grabbing something when you're interacting with objects in VR. It's one of the nicest VR headsets I've played with, but I'm a big believer in buying things based on what they are, not what they promise to be.</h2>
